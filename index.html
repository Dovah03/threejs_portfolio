        <p>
          Hi There! I'm Mehdi Aguendich, a Full-stack developer, Flutter Developer, Angular Developer
          and open source contributor based in Morocco. I have been developing
          all sorts of applications for over 3.5 years now, and have recently created many
          Angular11 based projects. Also I have worked in teams for various startups
          as either an Intern or a freelancer and helped them in launching their products/applications. and thus earned valuable learning experience.<br />
          I recently got my Engineering Degree at the Morrocan School of Engineering Sciences (E.M.S.I) and am currently working on developing my personal AI Assistant.
